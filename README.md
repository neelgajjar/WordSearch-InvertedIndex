# WordSearch-InvertedIndex
Inverted indexes are the most fundamental and widely used data structures in information retrieval.  
For each unique word occurring in a document collection, the inverted index stores a list of the documents in which this word occurs.  
For each word in this collection is called a term and corresponding to each term we maintain a list, called inverted list, of all the documentsin which this word appears.
